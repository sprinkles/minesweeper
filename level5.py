# Level 5
# Define a "move" function that, when given a mine board and a status board, immediately calls the end-of-game checking function. If it returns 0, then the this function should return 2. Otherwise, this function prompts for a location and then uncovers that square using the function from Level 3. If the uncovering function returns a 0, this function should display the board using the procedure from Level 1 and return a 0. If the uncovering function returns a 1, then the pyrotechnic display procedure from Level 2 should be called and a value of 1 returned.
